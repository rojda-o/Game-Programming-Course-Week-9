# Game-Programming-Course-Week-9

In the ninth week of the Game Programming course, I focused on adding more advanced gameplay features and improving the visual effects of the game. This project involves implementing explosion animations for enemies and asteroids, adding asteroid mechanics with random spawning, and creating dynamic thruster damage effects. The project also includes spawn delay management and enhanced collision handling.

This project demonstrates the following fundamental skills:

- Implementing explosion animations for enemies and asteroids.
- Managing asteroid movement and spawning with dynamic prefab instantiation.
- Adding a damage feedback system with thruster damage animations.
- Using Coroutines to manage spawn delays and control object destruction timing.

This project helped me deepen my understanding of Unity's animation system, prefab management, and Coroutines, while also expanding my skills in handling dynamic gameplay mechanics and visual effects.
